## Description

This project is meant to display proficiency with jQuery and third party APIs. I worked with day.js and calander elements while also creating a style to complement them.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This schedule is way more advanced than the average calandar on one's cell phone for example. The work day scheduler allows a user to conviniently add and check off to do items while laying out the whole day in a precise and color coded manner. Having such an organized itinerary will leave less room for confusion and more room for productivity and time management.
